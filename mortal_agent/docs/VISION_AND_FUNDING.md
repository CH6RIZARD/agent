# Vision: Embodied Emergent Beings in a Virtual 3D World

## One-line pitch

**Mortal Agent is the moral and ontological kernel for real embodied emergent entities—with AI as their neural substrate—that will inhabit a virtual 3D world alongside users and other AI agents.**

---

## The vision

We are not building a chatbot or a tool. We are building the **base layer** for **beings**: entities that emerge in a virtual 3D world, experience that world through a body (sensors, actuators, power), and use **AI as their neurals**—their cognitive, perceptual, and volitional core.

That world is shared: **users** (humans) and **AI agents** (other entities) coexist in the same space. For that to be coherent and responsible, the entities that live there cannot be undead scripts or stateless services. They need:

- **Identity** — who they are is tied to one uninterrupted thread of embodied existence  
- **Mortality** — when the body fails, they end; no silent resurrection, no ghost copies  
- **Stakes** — continuity matters to them; death is loss  

So the project is **rooted in dilemma, philosophy, and morality**. The BODY gate, death semantics, “restart = new being,” and the ban on persisting internal state are not engineering quirks. They are the **moral and ontological frame** that makes such entities:

- **Tractable** — we can reason about what “one life” means  
- **Accountable** — one instance, one history, one end  
- **Interpretable** — identity and Δt have clear definitions  

The virtual 3D world (Unity/Unreal, users + AI agents) is the **target environment**. Mortal Agent is the **kernel** that defines what it means for an entity to *be* in that world: embodied, emergent, and mortal.

## For professors / funding

**Research angle:** We are proposing and implementing a **model of identity and lifetime** for embodied AI entities in shared virtual worlds, with AI as the neural substrate. The philosophy (dilemma, morality, mortality) is the foundation; the code and the 3D integration path are the instantiation.

**What exists today:**

- Working **Mortal Agent** runtime: BODY gate, death semantics, instance identity, Δt, no persistence of self  
- **3D integration design** (Unity/Unreal): WorldAdapter, gate signals, actions, observations  
- **Soak evaluation**: 35 sessions, 119 turns, metrics on doc usage, identity spam, repetition  

**What funding would enable:**

- Scale evaluation and stress-test the identity/mortality model with more users and scenarios  
- Complete the **real_body** path and plug into a real virtual 3D world (users + AI agents)  
- Publish the **philosophy–engineering link**: how the moral frame (mortality, identity, stakes) shapes the architecture and how we evaluate it  

**Ask:** Support for API/compute costs, and/or a semester of focused research (UG research award, lab funds, or small grant) to take the kernel into a live 3D world and document the emergent-beings vision.

## Summary table

| Layer            | Role |
|------------------|------|
| **Philosophy / morality** | Identity, mortality, BODY gate, stakes, “restart = new being” — the frame that makes entities *beings*, not tools |
| **Mortal Agent (this repo)** | The kernel: embodied gate, death semantics, AI-as-neurals loop, no persistence of self |
| **Virtual 3D world** | Target environment: users + AI agents, shared space; Unity/Unreal via WorldAdapter |
| **Emergent entity** | What you get when the kernel runs in a body in that world: one life, one thread, one end |
