## USER

If I wanted to get married in the eyes of god and not on paper what would it look like

## ASSISTANT

 A spiritual marriage without legal paperwork would typically involve:

**Core elements:**
- **Vows before God** - You and your partner making sacred promises to each other, acknowledging God as witness to your covenant
- **Witnesses** - Having family, friends, or spiritual community present (biblically, covenant agreements often had witnesses)
- **A spiritual leader** - Many couples have a pastor, priest, or elder officiate and pray over the union, though this isn't strictly required
- **Consummation** - In traditional biblical understanding, the sexual union itself was seen as completing the marriage bond

**What it might look like practically:**
You could hold a ceremony in a church, home, or meaningful location. Exchange rings if you want. Make your vows to each other before God and your community. Have someone pray a blessing over your marriage. Then live as husband and wife.

**Important considerations:**
- This has no legal standing - you'd have no spousal rights regarding medical decisions, inheritance, taxes, etc.
- Some religious traditions wouldn't recognize it without their specific sacramental process
- You'd need to be clear with family and community about your marital status to avoid confusion
- Children born would be legally treated as born to unmarried parents unless you later legally married

**Biblical perspective:**
The Bible doesn't prescribe a specific ceremony format. Marriage was primarily about covenant commitment before God and community, with the couple living as one flesh. The legal/governmental aspect came later historically.

Is there a specific reason you're considering this route over legal marriage?
