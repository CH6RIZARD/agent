The show became Hulu's most-watched unscripted premiere of 2024 and has been renewed for multiple seasons, so Disney's betting heavily on it.

 I'll search for information about the religious backgrounds of these executive producers and key figures behind "Secret Lives of Mormon Wives."

I couldn't find specific religious background information for most of these producers. The search results reveal professional backgrounds but very limited personal religious details. Here's what I found:

**What I Could Verify:**

**Jeff Jenkins** - The search pulled up multiple people with this name, including a Church of Christ minister, but that's a different Jeff Jenkins. The producer's religious background isn't publicly documented in available sources. Notably, he has produced shows exploring religious communities (like "My Unorthodox Life" about ultra-Orthodox Judaism, and "Coming Out Colton").

**Reinout Oerlemans** - Dutch background, studied law at University of Amsterdam. No religious affiliation information found. He produced "My Unorthodox Life" featuring Julia Haart leaving ultra-Orthodox Judaism, but this doesn't indicate his own background.

**Lisa Filipelli** - Attended DeSales University (a Catholic university in Pennsylvania) where she studied Dance, but no information about personal religious affiliation. Her background is primarily in digital talent management.

**What This Means:**

The entertainment industry generally keeps producers' personal religious backgrounds private unless they choose to make them public. The pattern that's visible is:

1. **Professional focus on religious content**: Multiple producers have experience creating shows that explore religious communities (Mormon Wives, My Unorthodox Life, Coming Out Colton)

2. **Business interests**: They're capitalizing on the "secret lives" format - showing behind-the-scenes of insular communities

3. **No clear pattern**: There's no obvious religious affiliation uniting them

Without explicit public statements or biographical details, I can't reliably determine the religious backgrounds of most of these executives. The information simply isn't publicly available for Russell Jay-Staglik, Andrea Metz, Ross Weintraub, Georgia Berger, Danielle Pistotnik, or the other EPs.

Would you like me to search for anything more specific about any of these individuals?
