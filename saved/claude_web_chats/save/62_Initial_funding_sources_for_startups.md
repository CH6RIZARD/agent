How did got get funding initially

## ASSISTANT

 I need a bit more context - are you asking about how **you** initially got funding for one of your ventures (like Impact Hero or SCION AI), or are you asking about how a specific company got their initial funding?

If you're asking about funding strategies for your own projects, I can help you think through bootstrapping approaches, pitch strategies, or funding sources that might work for your situation.

If you're asking about a specific company (like one you researched for class - Palantir, OpenAI, etc.), let me know which one and I can search for details about their early funding rounds.

## USER

Gpt/ Sam Altman

## ASSISTANT

 I'll search for information about OpenAI's initial funding and how Sam Altman got it started.

Here's how OpenAI got its initial funding:

## The Original 2015 Launch

OpenAI started in December 2015 with **$1 billion in pledged funding** from a group of tech heavyweights and companies:

**Key backers:**
- Sam Altman (co-chair, then president of Y Combinator)
- Elon Musk (co-chair)
- Peter Thiel
- Reid Hoffman (LinkedIn co-founder)
- Jessica Livingston
- Greg Brockman
- Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Infosys

**Reality check:** Only **$130 million** of that $1 billion was actually collected by 2019. Some pledged backers like Y Combinator Research apparently never contributed their funds.

## The Nonprofit Strategy

Initially launched as a **nonprofit research lab** with the mission of developing AGI safely. Altman recalls trying to raise $100 million for a nonprofit in front of Silicon Valley investors - described as a "staggering amount" at the time.

The nonprofit angle was strategic - it was meant to counter profit-driven companies like Google (which had just acquired DeepMind) and ensure AI development benefited humanity rather than just shareholders.

## The 2019 Pivot to "Capped Profit"

By 2019, they realized the nonprofit structure was financially unsustainable. Computing costs were doubling every 3.4 months, and they needed serious capital fast.

Altman led the restructure to a **"capped profit" model**:
- Created OpenAI LP (limited partnership)
- Investors could get up to 100x returns, anything beyond that flows to the nonprofit
- This allowed them to raise real VC money while maintaining nonprofit oversight

**First major VC investment:** Khosla Ventures injected $50 million at a $1 billion valuation, becoming the first traditional VC to invest.

## The Microsoft Partnership

The big breakthrough came when Altman secured the first **$1 billion investment from Microsoft** after the 2019 restructure, giving OpenAI access to Azure's massive cloud computing infrastructure. That relationship has since grown to over **$13 billion** in total Microsoft investment.

## What's Interesting for Your Situation

The OpenAI funding story is actually pretty wild for a few reasons:

1. **Pledges vs. Reality** - They announced $1B but only collected $130M initially. The hype got them in the door.

2. **Mission-driven narrative** - The "saving humanity from dangerous AI" pitch helped them raise from people who wouldn't normally fund a nonprofit.

3. **Strategic pivot** - When the nonprofit model hit limits, they restructured rather than dying. The "capped profit" model let them have their cake and eat it too.

4. **Infrastructure partnerships** - The Microsoft deal wasn't just money - it was access to compute that would've cost billions to build themselves.

Altman also joked later about the absurdity of startup funding rounds, tweeting sarcastically about raising a "Series A" after doing "pre-friends-and-family," "F&F," "angel," "pre-seed," "seed," and "seed extension" rounds - poking fun at how convoluted startup fundraising has become.
