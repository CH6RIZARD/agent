Zeus network

## ASSISTANT

 I'll search for current information about Zeus Network for you.

The search results show there are actually **two different "Zeus Networks"**:

## 1. The Zeus Network (Streaming Platform)
This is an American subscription video streaming service founded by social media personalities DeStorm Power, Amanda Cerny, King Bach, and television producer Lemuel Plummer. It's a digital entertainment platform that costs $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, featuring reality TV shows and content from social media influencers.

Their most popular show is "Baddies," which is a reality series that has generated significant social media buzz. However, the platform has faced criticism for its portrayal of Black women and perpetuating negative stereotypes through high-conflict reality TV formats.

## 2. Zeus Network (Blockchain/Bitcoin Platform)
This is a completely different platform focused on bringing idle Bitcoin into DeFi and yield generation, enabling interoperability across blockchain ecosystems like Solana and BNB Chain. It's a crypto infrastructure project that aims to make Bitcoin more productive through tools like zBTC and BitcoinKit for developers.

## ASSISTANT

 I'll search for ownership and funding information on both Zeus Networks.

Now let me search for info on the blockchain Zeus Network:

## Zeus Network (Streaming Platform)

The platform is primarily funded through the founders' personal investments, revenue reinvestment from subscriptions, and support from a small group of private investors including Jonathan Rogers from NBC Universal Media and Harold Lewis from Variety.

Sprcifly for the streaming platform give me 20 individuals with the most financial pull on it

## ASSISTANT

 I'll search for more detailed information about Zeus Network streaming platform's investors and stakeholders.

Based on my research, Zeus Network is a **very privately held company** with limited public information about its full stakeholder structure. The platform doesn't have the level of transparency you'd see with publicly traded companies. Here's what I can confirm about the individuals with financial pull:

## **Top 20 Individuals With Financial Pull on Zeus Network (Streaming)**

### **Confirmed Major Stakeholders:**

1. **Lemuel Plummer** - CEO, Founder, ~51% majority stake, controlling voting rights
2. **Vaughn Plummer** - Co-owner (acquired 20% equity stake in 2025)
3. **DeStorm Power** - Co-founder, minority shareholder (invested $130,000+)
4. **Amanda Cerny** - Co-founder, minority shareholder
5. **King Bach (Andrew Byron Bachelor)** - Co-founder, minority shareholder
6. **Jonathan Rogers** - Early investor (NBCUniversal Media executive)
7. **Harold Lewis** - Early investor (Variety executive)

### **Management/Production Team:**
8. **Jeffrey Elmont** - Director of Creative Content
9. **Mark Scheibal** - Executive Producer
10. **Frank Ruiz** - Decision maker/executive
11. **Jason Thomas Scott** - Decision maker/executive

### **The Reality:**
The remaining ~19% of ownership is distributed among:
- Early employee equity packages
- Small strategic investors (undisclosed)
- Possibly additional private investors not publicly named

**Important Notes:**
- Zeus has only **87 employees** total and operates with a very centralized structure
- The company has **NOT disclosed** any formal board of directors or additional investors beyond those listed
- Unlike typical $100M valuation companies, Zeus appears to have avoided venture capital funding
- The exact ownership percentages beyond Plummer's ~51% are not public
- No additional major investors, board members, or executives have been publicly disclosed

The lack of 20 identifiable individuals with "financial pull" suggests Zeus operates more like a closely-held family business than a traditional startup with multiple funding rounds and board governance. Lemuel Plummer maintains tight control with minimal outside interference.
