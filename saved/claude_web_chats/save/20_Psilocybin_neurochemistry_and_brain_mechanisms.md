Established Mechanisms — Delivery Pathways #MechanismMedium/RouteHow It Works in Detail15-HT2A receptor agonismOral ingestion → gut absorption → liver conversion → bloodstream → crosses blood-brain barrier (BBB)You eat the mushroom. Stomach acid breaks down chitin cell walls. Psilocybin absorbs through intestinal lining into portal vein. Liver enzyme alkaline phosphatase removes phosphate group, converting to psilocin. Psilocin is lipophilic (fat-soluble) so it crosses BBB within 20-40 min. Binds directly to 5-HT2A receptor's orthosteric site.25-HT2C receptor activationSame oral → liver → BBB routeIdentical pathway. Psilocin has slightly lower affinity for 2C than 2A, but still significant binding. 2C receptors concentrated in choroid plexus, limbic areas.35-HT1A receptor bindingSame metabolic routePsilocin reaches these receptors in raphe nuclei, hippocampus. Lower binding affinity than 2A, but contributes to calming effects.4Default Mode Network suppressionIndirect — downstream effect of 5-HT2A bindingNot a direct chemical binding. Once psilocin hits 5-HT2A receptors on pyramidal neurons in prefrontal cortex, those neurons change firing patterns. DMN nodes (medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate) reduce synchronized activity.5Increased global connectivityIndirect — network-level cascade5-HT2A activation → glutamate release → AMPA receptor activation → cascading excitation across normally segregated networks. Takes ~60-90 min to fully manifest.6Thalamic gating disruptionPsilocin directly reaches thalamic 5-HT2A receptorsThalamus is "relay station." Normally filters sensory input. Psilocin binding reduces this filtering. Sensory overload reaches cortex.7Glutamate release increaseIndirect — 5-HT2A activation on presynaptic terminals5-HT2A receptors on layer V pyramidal neurons trigger glutamate release when activated. This is secondary to psilocin binding.8Neuroplasticity/BDNF upregulationIntracellular signaling cascadePsilocin → 5-HT2A → Gq protein → phospholipase C → protein kinase C → CREB activation → BDNF gene transcription. Takes hours to days.9Dendritic spine growthSame intracellular pathway + TrkB activationBDNF release → TrkB receptor binding → mTOR pathway → protein synthesis → physical spine growth. Visible within 24 hours, peaks 3 days.10Amygdala modulationDirect psilocin binding in amygdalaPsilocin crosses BBB, reaches amygdala's 5-HT2A receptors. Reduces fear response, increases emotional processing.11Claustrum disruptionDirect binding — claustrum has highest 5-HT2A density in brainPsilocin preferentially accumulates here due to receptor density. This thin sheet of neurons coordinates consciousness integration.12Visual cortex hyperactivationDirect + indirectDirect: psilocin binds V1/V2 area receptors. Indirect: reduced thalamic filtering sends more signal to visual cortex.13Temporal lobe stimulationDirect binding + network effectsTemporal 5-HT2A receptors + reduced DMN → mystical experiences, time distortion, déjà vu.14Prefrontal cortex changesDirect high-density bindingPFC has abundant 5-HT2A. Psilocin alters executive function, abstract thinking, self-reflection.15Entropy increaseEmergent property of all aboveNot a direct mechanism — mathematical description of brain state.
