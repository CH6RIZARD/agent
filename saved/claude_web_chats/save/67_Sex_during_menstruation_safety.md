 Having sex during menstruation is completely safe and normal if both partners are comfortable with it. Here's what you should know:

**Physical aspects:**
- It's safe - you can't get hurt or cause harm
- She can still get pregnant (sperm can survive several days)
- Use protection for both pregnancy and STI prevention
- Blood acts as natural lubrication, though you might want extra lube anyway

**Practical considerations:**
- Put down a dark towel to protect sheets
- Shower sex can minimize mess
- She might have more or less sensitivity/desire during her period
- Cramps might actually improve for her due to orgasm-induced muscle contractions

**Communication is key:**
- Ask her comfort level - some women prefer it, some don't
- Don't make her feel weird about it either way
- Check in during if it's your first time doing this together

**Cleanup:**
- Keep tissues/wet wipes nearby
- Warm water cleans blood easily
- Don't be squeamish - it's just a normal bodily function

The main thing is mutual comfort and respect. If you're both into it, there's no medical or health reason not to. If either of you isn't comfortable, that's completely valid too.
