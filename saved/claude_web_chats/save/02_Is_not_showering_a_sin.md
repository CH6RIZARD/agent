When I go days without showering is it a sin

## ASSISTANT

 I appreciate you asking this directly. Let me break down how different theological traditions would approach this:

**Biblical Christianity** doesn't classify lack of showering as sin. The biblical concept of sin centers on rebellion against God's nature and commands - things like idolatry, sexual immorality, injustice, hatred, and dishonesty. Personal hygiene isn't addressed as a moral category in Scripture.

The Old Testament had ritual purity laws about washing, but even then these were about ceremonial cleanness for worship, not moral sin. Christians generally understand these as fulfilled in Christ and no longer binding.

**However**, there are some indirect theological angles:

The Bible does talk about stewardship of your body (1 Corinthians 6:19-20) and loving your neighbor. If not showering is part of neglecting your health or making it difficult for others to be around you, some would argue it could fall under failing to care for yourself or love others well - but this is still different from calling it "sin" in the direct sense.

**More relevant question**: If you're going days without showering regularly, the theological concern wouldn't be about sin but about what's going on with you. Depression, exhaustion, burnout, or other struggles often show up in hygiene habits first. From a Christian perspective, the issue isn't guilt but care - both self-care as stewardship and seeking support if you're struggling.

Is there something specific making this question come up for you right now?
