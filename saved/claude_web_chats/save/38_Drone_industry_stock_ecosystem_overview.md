## 📊 KEY TAKEAWAYS

**All companies listed are PUBLIC** — no private companies in your list.

**Hot Momentum Plays:**
- 🔥 **UMAC** — Up huge on defense orders, FCC Chinese drone ban benefits
- 🔥 **DRO.AX** — +560% 1-year, counter-drone demand exploding
- 🔥 **KTOS** — +175% YTD, defense UAS momentum
- 🔥 **ESLT** — All-time highs, Israeli defense demand

**Largest by Market Cap:**
1. QCOM (~$170B)
2. RTX (~$150B)
3. BA (~$145B)
4. LMT (~$140B)
5. NOC (~$69B)

**Smallest/Speculative:**
- GPRO (~$232M) — distressed
- UAVS (~<$50M) — penny territory
- DPRO (~$196M) — volatile small-cap

## USER

what is market cap

## ASSISTANT

 **Market Cap (Market Capitalization)** = the total value of a company's stock

---

## The Simple Formula:

```
Market Cap = Stock Price × Total Shares Outstanding
```

---

## Example:

If **UMAC** trades at **$19.44** and has **36.8 million shares** out there:

> $19.44 × 36,800,000 = **~$716 million market cap**

That means if you wanted to buy the *entire company* at today's price, it would cost ~$716 million.

---

## Size Categories:

| Category | Market Cap Range |
|----------|------------------|
| **Mega Cap** | $200B+ (QCOM, RTX, Boeing) |
| **Large Cap** | $10B – $200B (Lockheed, Northrop) |
| **Mid Cap** | $2B – $10B (Ambarella, AeroVironment) |
| **Small Cap** | $250M – $2B (UMAC, Red Cat, EHang) |
| **Micro Cap** | $50M – $250M (Draganfly, GoPro) |
| **Nano Cap** | <$50M (AgEagle/UAVS territory) |

---

## Why It Matters:

- **Bigger cap** = more stable, less volatile, harder to manipulate
- **Smaller cap** = more volatile, higher risk, bigger potential swings (up AND down)

For your SCION glasses project, the **small/micro caps** (UMAC, DPRO, RCAT) are the ones moving 10-20% in a day on news. The mega caps barely flinch.

## ASSISTANT

 Real talk — **yes and no.**

---

## ✅ WHY SMALL CAPS = BIG UPSIDE

| Factor | Example |
|--------|---------|
| **10x easier** | UMAC going $2 → $20 is realistic. Boeing going $234 → $2,340? Never happening. |
| **Under the radar** | Big funds can't buy tiny stocks — you get in before them |
| **One contract changes everything** | UMAC gets a $3.75M order → stock jumps 15% overnight |
| **Low float** | Fewer shares = price moves faster on volume |

**UMAC went from ~$4.45 to ~$19 in months** — that's a 4x on a small defense drone play.

---

## ❌ WHY SMALL CAPS = BIG RISK

| Factor | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **They die faster** | GoPro was $93 in 2014, now $1.37. UAVS was $60 in 2021, now $1.39. |
| **No profit cushion** | Most are burning cash. One bad quarter = 50% drop |
| **Manipulation** | Low volume = easy pump and dumps |
| **Dilution** | They constantly issue new shares to survive, killing your stake |
| **Liquidity trap** | Hard to sell when everyone's running for the exit |

---

## THE REAL GAME:

```
Small Cap = High Risk, High Reward
Large Cap = Low Risk, Low Reward (but consistent)
```

**The move is:**

| Strategy | Allocation |
|----------|------------|
| 🎰 **Speculation** (UMAC, DPRO, RCAT, DRO) | 10-20% of portfolio |
| 🏦 **Core holdings** (AVAV, KTOS, RTX) | 50-60% |
| 💰 **Cash/safe** | 20-30% for dips |

---

## BOTTOM LINE FOR YOU:

You're young, building businesses, can stomach risk. Small caps make sense for **a portion** — but don't go 100% micro caps thinking it's guaranteed money. 

**The graveyard of penny stocks is filled with people who thought "small = easy 10x."**

Pick 2-3 small caps you actually understand (like the drone/FPV space you're researching for SCION), size positions where a 50% loss doesn't kill you, and let the thesis play out.

## 🎯 THE LESSON

**Small caps CAN 10x... but they can also go to zero.**

| Stock | Peak → Now | Lesson |
|-------|------------|--------|
| UAVS | $62 → $1.39 | Meme pumps don't last |
| GPRO | $93 → $1.37 | Cool product ≠ good stock |
| DPRO | $90 → $9.59 | Hype fades without revenue |
| KTOS | $18 → $130 | Real contracts = real gains |
| UMAC | $4 → $19 | Right sector + execution = winner |

**The difference?** KTOS and UMAC have actual defense contracts and revenue growth. The graveyard stocks had hype but no fundamentals.
