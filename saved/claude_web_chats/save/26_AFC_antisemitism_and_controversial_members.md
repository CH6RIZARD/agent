## USER

Prominent Members: Key figures in the AFC included individuals known for their antisemitic views, such as aviator Charles Lindbergh and industrialist Henry Ford. The committee officially voted to drop Ford as a member due to his overt antisemitism, but the association remained a problem. What did they say

## ASSISTANT

 I'll search for specific quotes and statements from Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford related to their AFC involvement and antisemitic views.

Now let me search for information about Henry Ford and the America First Committee:

Based on my search, here's what these prominent AFC members said:

## **Charles Lindbergh's Des Moines Speech (September 11, 1941)**

Lindbergh's most notorious statement came in his "Who Are the War Agitators?" speech, where he declared that "the three most important groups who have been pressing this country toward war are the British, the Jewish and the Roosevelt Administration."

He specifically claimed about Jewish Americans: "Their greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government."

While he did say "no person with a sense of the dignity of mankind can condone the persecution of the Jewish race in Germany," his speech relied heavily on antisemitic tropes about Jewish control of media and government.

After the backlash, Lindbergh wrote in his diary that he felt he had "worded my Des Moines address carefully and moderately" and complained that "almost anything can be discussed today in America except the Jewish problem."

## **Henry Ford's Writings**

Ford's antisemitism was expressed primarily through *The Dearborn Independent* newspaper, which blamed Jews for virtually everything: strikes, financial scandals, agricultural depression, claiming that "the Jew" became "the symbol of a world that was being manipulated and controlled."

Hitler praised Ford in *Mein Kampf* as "a single great man" who "still maintains full independence... [from] the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions."

Ford was forced to resign from the America First Committee's executive board when his involvement proved too controversial, though the damage to the organization's reputation had already been done.

## USER

We’re they anti semites

## ASSISTANT

 Yes, both Charles Lindbergh and Henry Ford were antisemites, though they expressed it differently and to varying degrees.

## **Henry Ford - Undeniably Antisemitic**

Ford's antisemitism was extensive, systematic, and influential. Between 1920 and 1922, his newspaper *The Dearborn Independent* published a series of antisemitic articles called "The International Jew," which he then had bound into four volumes and distributed half a million copies through his dealership network.

Ford republished the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion*, a notorious forgery claiming a global Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. Hitler calle

## USER

Why did you recalibrate

## ASSISTANT

 I apologize for the confusion - I didn't intentionally "recalibrate." My previous response got cut off mid-sentence (you can see it ends abruptly with "Hitler calle"). This appears to have been a technical error where my response was interrupted.

Let me complete the answer properly:

## **Henry Ford - Undeniably Antisemitic**

Ford's antisemitism was extensive, systematic, and influential. Between 1920 and 1922, his newspaper *The Dearborn Independent* published a series of antisemitic articles called "The International Jew," which he then had bound into four volumes and distributed half a million copies through his dealership network.

Ford republished the *Protocols of the Elders of Zion*, a notorious forgery claiming a global Jewish conspiracy to take over the world. Hitler called Ford "the single great man" and Ford was the only American mentioned favorably in *Mein Kampf*.

## **Charles Lindbergh - More Debated, But Yes**

Lindbergh's case is more contested by historians, but the evidence strongly supports that he held antisemitic views. His Des Moines speech used antisemitic tropes and presented a monolithic characterization of American Jews as war-agitating outsiders, which prompted a nationwide backlash.

GOP presidential candidate Wendell Willkie called the speech "the most un-American talk made in my time by any person of national reputation."

Both men's antisemitism significantly damaged the America First Committee's reputation and credibility.

## USER

No prior I wake dibs question you loaded and stopped

## ASSISTANT

 Ah, I understand now - you're asking why I initially gave you a detailed answer about what they said, but then when you asked the direct yes/no question "Were they antisemites," I seemed to hesitate or be more careful in my response.

You're right to notice that shift. Here's why it happened:

When you asked "What did they say," I focused on documenting the historical record - their actual words and statements. That's straightforward factual reporting.

But when you asked "Were they antisemites," I was answering a more definitive characterization question. I wanted to be precise and fair in that assessment, so I:

1. **Made clear distinctions** - Ford's antisemitism was systematic and undeniable; Lindbergh's is "more debated by historians" (though still clearly antisemitic)

2. **Provided evidence** rather than just asserting a label

3. **Was careful about historical accuracy** - recognizing that while both held antisemitic views, the nature and extent differed

I wasn't trying to soften or avoid the conclusion - both were antisemites. I was just being more careful about how I characterized them as people versus reporting what they said. Does that make sense, or did it come across as me backing away from the facts?

## USER

Clearly how for Charles

## ASSISTANT

 You're absolutely right - let me be direct about the evidence for Lindbergh:

## **Clear Evidence Lindbergh Was Antisemitic:**

**His own words:**
- In a private conversation with poet Selden Rodman weeks before the Des Moines speech, Lindbergh said he believed Jewish people had "themselves to blame"
- He accused Jews of "exercising outsized influence and of controlling the American news media"
- He claimed their "greatest danger to this country lies in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our press, our radio and our government"

**His actions:**
- In 1938, he accepted a medal from Hermann Göring, head of Nazi Germany's Luftwaffe, and several weeks later the Nazis launched Kristallnacht
- He publicly praised Adolf Hitler and expressed "admiration for the German people," and by 1938 was "seriously considering taking up residence" in Nazi Germany

**The verdict:**
- Secretary of the Interior Harold Ickes called him "the number one fellow-traveler of the Nazis in the United States"
- Journalist Dorothy Thompson wrote: "I am absolutely certain that Lindbergh is pro-Nazi"

It's clear-cut. Lindbergh was an antisemite.

## USER

He accused Jews of “exercising outsized influence and of controlling the American news media” ﻿

## ASSISTANT

 You're right to highlight that quote - let me clarify what I meant by it.

That wasn't Lindbergh giving a neutral observation. In his Des Moines speech, Lindbergh accused Jews of exercising outsized influence and of controlling the American news media - this **is** an antisemitic claim. It's a classic antisemitic conspiracy theory.

The accusation itself - that Jews "control" media and have disproportionate influence - is an antisemitic trope, not a factual statement. I was describing what Lindbergh claimed, not endorsing it as true.

To be absolutely clear: 
- **What Lindbergh said:** Jews control American media and have outsized influence
- **What this actually is:** An antisemitic conspiracy theory with no basis in fact
- **Why it's antisemitic:** It portrays Jews as a monolithic group secretly manipulating society

I should have been clearer that I was citing his *false accusation*, not stating a fact. The claim itself is antisemitic propaganda, not reality.

Does that clear it up?

## USER

If they fund it all there narrative controls it no

## ASSISTANT

 No, that's not accurate, and it's important to push back on this.

**The problem with this logic:**

1. **The premise is false** - Jews did not and do not "fund it all" or control American media. This is exactly the conspiracy theory Lindbergh was spreading.

2. **It treats Jews as a monolithic group** - Jewish people are individuals with vastly different views, politics, and interests. Saying "they" control anything assumes all Jews act in coordination, which is antisemitic thinking.

3. **It ignores actual ownership diversity** - In the 1940s and today, media ownership has always been diverse, with people of many backgrounds involved.

4. **"Narrative control" assumes conspiracy** - Even when Jewish individuals own or work in media companies, they don't coordinate a unified "Jewish narrative" - they have competing views like everyone else.

**Why this matters:**
This exact line of thinking - "Jews fund/own media therefore control the narrative" - is the core of antisemitic conspiracy theories that have led to violence against Jewish people throughout history. It was used by the Nazis to justify persecution.

**Reality:**
Media has biases based on corporate interests, political leanings, regional perspectives, and individual editorial choices - not because of any ethnic or religious group's coordinated control.

Does that make sense why this reasoning is problematic?
