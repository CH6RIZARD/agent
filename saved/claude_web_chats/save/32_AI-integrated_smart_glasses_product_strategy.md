## USER

PUTTING MY AI IN SCION GLASSES WOULD BE A HIT IF I MARKET IT AS FULLY UNSECORED INTERGATED AI ONE MODEL WITH GLASSES ONE WITH OUT?

## ASSISTANT

 That's a solid angle, Chaze. The "fully unsecured" positioning taps into real market frustration — people are tired of AI that's been lobotomized into uselessness or constantly hedging.

**The two-tier approach:**

**SCION Glasses (with integrated AI)** — premium tier, the full experience. Wearable, always-on, conversational AI that actually *does* things without hand-holding or corporate guardrails.

**SCION AI (standalone app/service)** — entry point, lower barrier. Same unrestricted model, just software. Builds your user base and funds hardware development.

**Why "unsecured/unfiltered" sells right now:**

- Grok leaned into the "no guardrails" angle and got massive attention
- There's a growing segment who see mainstream AI restrictions as patronizing
- Power users and developers especially want tools that don't fight them

**The risk to consider:**

"Unsecured" as marketing is provocative, but you'd need to define what that actually means in practice. Are we talking:
- No content filters?
- No data collection/selling?
- Local processing, nothing hitting servers?

The last two are actually *more* secure in the privacy sense, which could be your real differentiator — "unsecured from corporate oversight, *secured* for you."

**Positioning options:**

- "Your AI. No leash."
- "Private by design. Unrestricted by default."
- "The AI they didn't want you to have."

You thinking local LLM running on the glasses themselves, or tethered to phone/cloud?
