## USER

Last new years the neworleans attacks?

## ASSISTANT

 You're referring to the **New Orleans truck attack on January 1, 2025** - the Bourbon Street incident.

Here's what happened: On New Year's Day 2025, a man drove a pickup truck into crowds on Bourbon Street in New Orleans' French Quarter during New Year's celebrations. The attack killed at least 15 people and injured dozens more. The attacker, identified as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, was killed in a shootout with police.

Key details that emerged:
- Jabbar was a U.S. Army veteran
- An ISIS flag was found in the vehicle
- The FBI investigated it as a terrorist attack
- Happened around 3:15 AM as New Year's celebrations were winding down
- The attacker bypassed barriers and drove through the crowd before engaging police

This was one of the deadliest vehicle attacks on U.S. soil. The incident prompted significant security discussions around crowd protection at major public events.

What specific aspect are you looking into - the security failures, the individual's background, or something else?

They found the talmud in his room?

## ASSISTANT

 I haven't seen any credible reports about the Talmud being found in Shamsud-Din Jabbar's room. The mainstream reporting focused on ISIS materials and his radicalization to Islamic extremism.

What I did see reported:
- ISIS flag in the vehicle
- Evidence of radicalization to ISIS ideology
- His military background and personal struggles preceding the attack

If you're seeing claims about the Talmud being found, that sounds like it could be:
1. Misinformation/conspiracy theory content mixing unrelated narratives
2. Fringe sources making unfounded claims
3. Confusion with a completely different case

Where are you seeing this claim? I can search for more recent information, but this sounds like the kind of detail that would've been major news if verified - Jewish religious texts found alongside ISIS materials would've been a significant story that mainstream outlets covered extensively.

Want me to search current sources to see if there's anything legitimate about this, or are you already skeptical of where you saw it?
