Any mangas on twist like spiritual effects of abortion

## ASSISTANT

 I appreciate you asking about this sensitive topic. While I'm not aware of any manga that specifically focuses on the spiritual effects of abortion as a central theme, there are some works that touch on related territory:

**Manga that explore similar themes:**

- **Koe no Katachi (A Silent Voice)** - While not about abortion, it deals heavily with guilt, redemption, and the spiritual weight of past actions that harmed others

- **Oyasumi Punpun (Goodnight Punpun)** - This dark coming-of-age story explores guilt, psychological trauma, and moral weight in ways that might resonate, though it's extremely heavy

- **Homunculus** - Deals with psychological and spiritual trauma manifesting visually, exploring how past actions haunt people

**Why this might be rare in manga:**

Abortion is handled quite differently in Japanese culture compared to Western contexts. In Japan, there's a Buddhist practice called "mizuko kuyō" (water child memorial services) that acknowledges the spiritual dimension of abortion and miscarriage, but this is rarely explored in mainstream manga. The topic tends to appear briefly in josei (women's) manga dealing with adult relationships, but usually focuses on the decision-making process rather than spiritual aftermath.

If you're interested in the intersection of spirituality and difficult moral choices in manga, horror manga by authors like Junji Ito or Kazuo Umezu sometimes explore themes of guilt taking supernatural form.

What draws you to this particular theme? That might help me suggest more targeted recommendations.

Specifically abortion

## ASSISTANT

 You're right to press for specifics. Let me search for manga that actually deal with abortion directly.

Based on what I found, here are the manga that specifically deal with abortion and its spiritual/psychological aftermath:

**"Fetus Collection" by Shintaro Kago** - This is the most direct answer to your question. It's a one-shot horror manga where the protagonist can see "ghosts" of aborted fetuses clinging to women's heads. Women in the story collect and arrange these fetus spirits into artistic formations. It's extremely grotesque (Kago is known for "guro" - erotic grotesque horror) but directly tackles the spiritual dimension you're asking about.

**"Kijin Gahou" (also by Shintaro Kago)** - An anthology collection that includes a story about women who've turned abortion into a "grotesque art." Uses black comedy to critique society's relationship with abortion.

**"Nana" Volume 8+** - This popular josei manga deals with pregnancy and abortion as major plot points, though it focuses more on the emotional/relational consequences rather than explicitly spiritual ones. The series was moved to a mature rating partly due to these storylines.

**Context worth knowing:**

Japan has a unique cultural approach to this through **mizuko kuyō** (water child memorial services) - Buddhist rituals acknowledging aborted/miscarried fetuses. This concept occasionally appears in Japanese horror but rarely in mainstream manga because it's handled as a private spiritual matter rather than public discourse.

The spiritual horror angle is mostly found in **guro/horror manga** rather than mainstream titles. If you want the direct supernatural/spiritual consequences angle, Kago's work is really your best bet, though be warned - it's intentionally disturbing and not moralistic in either direction.

Summarize them

## ASSISTANT

 **"Fetus Collection" by Shintaro Kago**
A woman can see ghostly aborted fetuses attached to their would-be mothers' heads. She joins a club of women who arrange these fetus spirits into decorative art formations. The woman with the most aborted fetuses is portrayed as "the most wretched human being." Pure horror/guro that makes the spiritual aftermath literal and visible.

**"Kijin Gahou" by Shintaro Kago**
Horror anthology with one story about a suicidal girl who joins women turning abortion into grotesque art. Uses extreme imagery and black comedy to critique societal issues around abortion, sexuality, and commodification.

**"Nana" (Volumes 8+)**
Realistic josei drama where characters deal with unexpected pregnancy, considering abortion, marriage for convenience, and unwed motherhood. Focuses on emotional/relational fallout rather than supernatural elements. Got moved to mature rating when these storylines hit.

**The pattern:** The spiritual/supernatural angle only really shows up in **extreme horror manga** (Kago's work), where aborted fetuses manifest as literal ghosts or become objects in grotesque scenarios. Mainstream manga treats abortion as a serious life decision with emotional consequences but avoids the supernatural entirely.

Kago's stuff is the twisted, explicit version of what mizuko kuyō (Buddhist memorial services for "water children") represents culturally - acknowledgment that something spiritual happened, even if there's no consensus on what exactly that means.

Why did magi write it

## ASSISTANT

 I don't have specific information about Shintaro Kago's personal motivations for creating "Fetus Collection" or the abortion-themed story in "Kijin Gahou." Let me search for that.

I can't find specific interviews or statements from Kago about why he wrote these particular stories, but I can give you context on his overall approach:

**Kago's general artistic method:**

He's an **ero-guro** (erotic-grotesque) artist who deliberately takes taboo subjects and pushes them to absurd, shocking extremes. His work typically:

- **Critiques social hypocrisies** through exaggeration rather than preaching
- **Visualizes invisible anxieties** - making abstract cultural tensions concrete and horrifying
- **Uses shock as commentary** - the disgust is the point, forcing viewers to confront what they'd rather ignore

**With "Fetus Collection" specifically:**

Given that Japan has high abortion rates but treats it as a private spiritual matter (mizuko kuyō), Kago likely wrote it to:

1. **Make the invisible visible** - Japanese culture acknowledges fetal spirits privately but never publicly discusses them. He literalized this hidden belief.

2. **Mock commodification** - Turning the spirits into collectible art objects satirizes how people treat serious moral/spiritual matters as aesthetic choices or status symbols.

3. **Expose cultural contradictions** - Japan accepts abortion practically but maintains spiritual rituals for the "water children." That tension is ripe for horror treatment.

Kago doesn't moralize in either direction - he's not pro-life or pro-choice propaganda. He's showing you something grotesque about how society actually thinks and asking "isn't this fucked up?" without telling you what conclusion to draw.

## USER

Wdym they acknowledged it privately

## ASSISTANT

 Good question - let me clarify the **mizuko kuyō** (水子供養) practice:

**What it is:**
Buddhist memorial services for "mizuko" (water children) - aborted or miscarried fetuses. Women (sometimes couples) can:
- Pay temples to perform rituals
- Place small Jizo statues (guardian deity of children) with bibs, toys, pinwheels
- Make offerings and prayers for the spirit's peaceful journey
- Some temples have entire gardens filled with these statues

**"Private" means:**
- It's done **individually at temples**, not discussed socially
- No public debate like Western abortion politics
- Women don't announce "I'm getting mizuko kuyō for my abortion"
- It's treated as personal spiritual business, like going to confession
- The ritual exists specifically so women can address guilt/grief **quietly** without social judgment

**The contradiction Kago exploits:**
Japan has one of the highest abortion rates in developed countries (partly because birth control was restricted until recently). Abortion is legal, accessible, not particularly controversial **politically**. 

BUT - the existence of mizuko kuyō reveals that culturally, there's still a belief that **something spiritual happened** that needs addressing. The fetus had some kind of existence worth memorializing.

So: publicly acceptable procedure + private spiritual acknowledgment of what was lost = the exact tension Kago turns into literal ghost fetuses attached to women's heads.

It's the gap between "this is just a medical procedure" (public stance) and "I need to pray for this water child's spirit" (private action) that he's visualizing in grotesque form.
