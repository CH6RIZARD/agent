WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW
drones have developed and emerged a new style of ware fare, The technology has evolving . The disregard of endless thoughtless killing has only evolved aswell .    (remove vTHEN
Children in fields. String in hand. Eyes tracking paper against an open sky.
NOW
Operators in bunkers. Controllers in hand. Eyes on screens. No body comes home.)  add BKD pilots averga frrom 15- 29 in these modern abttles the youth had grrow up 
Modern warfare integrates civilian and youth skillsets into military systems, quietly reorganizing who participates and who defines outcome. Modern warfare increasingly removes physical presence while preserving consequence, closing the gap between MORALITY/ and military action. ( compare contrast 550 domestic flight infintne laws vs $400FPV + payload.
0International laws banning autonomous killer drones. ))) this adavnce in war robs families of funerals, No face-to-face combat  5,000 miles a man can murk you with out givng or taking any last worda 
Most people have no idea the slope of integrity war has fallen down

## ASSISTANT

 I'll update the awareness section copy based on your notes. Let me edit the HTML file.

Updated the awareness section with your revised copy:

**Key changes:**
- New headline: "Drones have developed and emerged **a new style of warfare.**"
- Removed the THEN/NOW columns
- Added the BKD pilots age stat (15-29) as highlighted text in the body copy
- Rewrote the main text to flow with your notes — technology evolved, disregard evolved, modern warfare integrates youth/civilian skills, removes physical presence while preserving consequence
- Added the "murk you from 5,000 miles" line about no last words
- Added the "slope of integrity" closing line
- Stats now show the $400 vs $550 flight comparison with a third stat (∞ laws governing a flight vs 0 for killer drones)

## USER

## ASSISTANT

 

Done. Changes made:

**Stats section — now 4 callouts:**
- $400 — FPV drone + payload
- $550 — Average domestic flight (red)
- 0 — International laws banning autonomous killer drones
- ∞ — Laws governing that $550 flight

**BAN section:**
- Removed "WHY WE ADVOCATE FOR A BAN" label
- Headline is now just **BEWARE**
- Removed "teenager with a" — now reads: "A gaming controller and basic coding skills now unlocks strike capability..."

## USER

can you use this as the hero tet , omptie tho and keep it the same size foroe mobile and deesktopif you can use us the boy and not he text and put it in the txt now do tht if u haev to se hte ong it self do tht ensure its hte sme sie and uakity and no speed drop

## ASSISTANT

 

Done. Added the boy with kite illustration to the hero section:

- Image sits next to the B.K.D text, aligned at the bottom
- Inverted to white (so it shows on the dark background)
- Same size on mobile and desktop using `clamp()` — scales proportionally with the text
- Original image quality preserved (PNG, no compression)
- `loading="eager"` ensures no delay on page load

Make sure both `index.html` and `hero-boy.png` are in the same folder when you deploy.

## USER

* Image sits next to the B.K.D text, aligned at the bottom
* Inverted to whit no this imgaes is the hero image can you use it or no or do i have to cut oiththe boy fomro the image

## ASSISTANT

 I can use the image as-is — let me place it properly in the hero. The boy will sit next to the B.K.D text, and the kite string will flow naturally since the image already has that composition.

## USER

B.K.D the boy in the png i ssitting on the same text that in thehtml embedded in theong if you use him you have to remvoe thetext,if your not pakninng to phot shop hi out

## ASSISTANT

 Got it — the B.K.D text is already in the image with the boy sitting on it. I'll just use the full PNG as the hero and remove the HTML text since it's redundant.

Done. Now the hero is just your PNG image (boy + B.K.D text + kite) — inverted to white, scales responsively, no duplicate text. Same quality, no performance hit.
