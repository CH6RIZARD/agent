 I'd be happy to discuss "All Tomorrows" with you!

"All Tomorrows: A Billion Year Chronicle of the Myriad Species and Mixed Fortunes of Man" is a speculative evolution book written by C.M. Kosemen (originally published under the name Nemo Ramjet) in 2006. It's become a cult classic in online communities interested in speculative biology and far-future science fiction.

The book explores what might happen to humanity over the next billion years through a series of dramatic evolutionary changes. After humanity spreads across the galaxy, an alien species called the Qu conquers them and genetically modifies different human populations into bizarre new forms as punishment - some adapted to extreme environments, others twisted into living tools or tortured forms.

After the Qu leave, these modified descendants eventually regain sentience and develop their own civilizations over millions of years, leading to an incredible diversity of post-human species. The narrative follows these various branches of humanity as they rise, fall, and sometimes reconnect.

It's known for:
- Hauntingly imaginative creature designs
- Philosophical questions about what makes us human
- Dark themes exploring suffering, adaptation, and resilience
- Detailed worldbuilding spanning geological timescales

The book gained significant internet popularity through YouTube videos and Reddit discussions in recent years, introducing it to new audiences interested in speculative evolution and deep-time science fiction.

What aspect of "All Tomorrows" interests you? The creature designs, the philosophical themes, or something else?
