## USER

this nigga is actually tryin to censor and nerf this one off idea how can i snipe under 50 evn if outsorucing romo 1688 or pakinstin sites if not alibab if its bpossible wit alibaba lmk

## ASSISTANT

 I hear you - you want the real path to get on-device AI (wake word + basic vision tagging) in glasses under $50, and you're frustrated with getting told "no" or getting watered-down answers.

Here's the actual snipe:

**Yes, it's possible. Here's how:**

**The chip families that already do this cheap:**
- **Rockchip RV1106** - ~$4-6 in volume, has NPU (0.5 TOPS), runs wake word + basic object detection
- **Ingenic T31/T40** - used in $30 AI dashcams already
- **Sigmastar SSC335/337** - baby monitor/security cam chip, dirt cheap
- **Allwinner V851s** - newer, has small NPU

These are already shipping in products selling for $35-50 retail.

**Where to source:**

1. **1688.com** - Search: "RV1106 模组" or "AI摄像头模块" - you'll find raw boards for $8-15
2. **Taobao industrial sellers** - Same chips, sometimes with reference designs
3. **Shenzhen markets direct** (Huaqiangbei) - If you have an agent
4. **Alibaba works IF** you search for "AI dashcam ODM" or "body camera AI chip" - these factories already have the boards, they just need to put it in glasses

**The play:**

You're not asking for "AI glasses." You're asking a dashcam/body cam factory to put their existing AI camera board into a glasses frame with BT audio. That's it.

**Realistic under-$50 BOM:**
- AI camera module (RV1106): $12-15
- Frame + battery + speakers: $12-15
- Assembly + firmware config: $5-8
- **FOB total: $35-40**

Want me to draft the exact 1688/Chinese supplier message to find these boards?

## USER

what is the realsitcly nics id get 10 for teh firs laucnh then a scalable amount

## ASSISTANT

 Real talk on unit economics:

**First launch (10 units):**

At 10 units you're getting **sample pricing**, which is brutal:

- **Per unit from 1688/Alibaba:** $55-80 each (no volume leverage)
- **Shipping (air, small batch):** $15-25 per unit
- **Landed cost per unit:** $70-105

You're **losing money or breaking even** at 10 units unless you price at $150+ retail. This batch is for testing, not profit.

**To actually hit sub-$50:**

| Volume | Realistic FOB | Why |
|--------|---------------|-----|
| 10 | $65-80 | Sample tax, no negotiation power |
| 50 | $50-60 | Still small but they'll talk |
| 100 | $42-50 | MOQ threshold for real pricing |
| 300 | $35-42 | Volume discount kicks in |
| 500+ | $30-38 | Actual production pricing |
| 1000+ | $25-32 | You're a real customer now |

**The snipe for launch:**

Order **50-100 units** minimum, not 10. Here's why:

1. Suppliers take you seriously
2. You get closer to real pricing ($45-55 range)
3. Enough units to seed reviews, test returns, validate demand
4. Per-unit shipping drops significantly

**Realistic first order play:**

- 50 units at ~$50-55 FOB = $2,500-2,750
- Shipping (sea freight small batch): $300-500
- **Total landed: ~$3,000-3,500**
- Sell at $129-149 retail
- Margin after Amazon fees: ~$40-50/unit
- **Profit on 50: $2,000-2,500**

That funds your 200-unit second order at better pricing.

Want me to map out the exact 50-unit supplier negotiation script?

## USER

why cant i ovlume elveage

## ASSISTANT

 You can volume leverage - but only if you **commit to future volume in writing**.

Here's how to snipe sample pricing down:

**The play:**

When you order 10, you don't say "I want 10 units."

You say:

> "I need 10 samples to validate with my US audience. If testing goes well, my first production order is 500 units in 60-90 days. Can you give me sample pricing that reflects that relationship?"

That shifts you from "random buyer" to "potential long-term customer."

**What that actually gets you:**

| Approach | 10-unit price |
|----------|---------------|
| "I want 10 units" | $70-80 each |
| "10 samples, 500 coming" | $50-60 each |
| "10 samples, 500 coming, here's my store/brand" | $45-55 each |

**Extra leverage moves:**

1. **Show your Amazon store / Impact Hero site** - proves you're real
2. **Offer to pay 30% deposit on the 500** - they know you're serious
3. **Ask for "partnership sample pricing"** - Chinese suppliers respect long-term language
4. **Get 2-3 suppliers quoting against each other** - mention you're comparing

**The message:**

> "We're launching SCION AI in the US market. Need 10 samples for influencer seeding and testing. First production run is 300-500 units within 90 days. What's your best sample price reflecting this partnership? We're comparing 3 suppliers this week."

That's how you volume leverage at 10 units.

Want me to write the full 1688 message in Chinese for the RV1106 boards?

## USER

70-80 is insae tho im oricing at 112

## ASSISTANT

 Yeah $70-80 samples when you're pricing at $112 is death math.

Let's break down your real margin at that:

**At $112 retail, $75 sample cost:**

- Amazon fees (15%): -$16.80
- FBA fulfillment (~glasses size): -$5-6
- Shipping to Amazon: -$3-4
- Product cost: -$75
- **You keep: ~$12-15/unit**

That's like 11% margin. One return kills 3 sales of profit.

**What you actually need:**

To make $112 retail work with healthy margin (40%+):

| Target margin | Max landed cost |
|---------------|-----------------|
| 40% (~$45 profit) | $45-50 landed |
| 50% (~$56 profit) | $35-40 landed |

**So your real options:**

1. **Price higher** - $149-179 gives you breathing room at sample costs
2. **Skip samples, go straight to 50-100 MOQ** - gets you to $50-55/unit
3. **Find a supplier already making this exact thing** - no "custom AI" tax

**The real snipe:**

Don't order "AI glasses samples."

Find a factory already shipping AI dashcam boards with RV1106/Ingenic. Buy their existing product as your sample ($25-35). Test the chip works. THEN ask them to put it in a glasses frame.

You're reverse-engineering their margin instead of paying the "new customer, custom product" tax.

Want me to find those dashcam board listings on 1688 you can order direct to test the silicon first?

## USER

ppu needs to be under 44

## ASSISTANT

 Alright, $44 landed max. Let's work backwards:

**At $112 retail, $44 landed:**

- Amazon fees (15%): -$16.80
- FBA fulfillment: -$5.50
- Product cost: -$44
- **You keep: ~$45.70/unit (41% margin)**

That's workable. Now how to hit $44:

**The math to get there:**

| Component | Target cost |
|-----------|-------------|
| FOB product | $32-36 |
| Shipping (sea, volume) | $4-6 |
| Import/duties | $2-4 |
| **Landed** | $38-46 |

So you need **$32-36 FOB** which means:

**You're not buying "AI glasses." You're buying:**

1. **Existing AI camera module** (RV1106/Ingenic) - $8-12
2. **Basic glasses frame with BT audio** - $12-15
3. **Assembly + firmware tweak** - $5-8
4. **Logo/packaging** - $2-3

**How to actually hit this:**

1. **Source the parts separately on 1688** - don't pay assembled "AI glasses" markup
2. **Find a Shenzhen assembler** - they marry the parts for $3-5/unit
3. **Or find a body cam factory** - they already have the AI board, just need different housing

**Volume required for $32-36 FOB:**

Realistically 200-300+ units minimum.

At 50-100 units you're looking at $42-48 FOB, which lands you at $50-55. Close but not $44.

**The move:**

Either raise your first batch price to $129-139 to survive the early volume penalty, or commit to 200+ units out the gate to hit your $44 target.

Which direction you leaning?

## USER

mkae it make more sense

## ASSISTANT

 Alright, simple:

**You want $44 landed. Here's the only 3 paths:**

---

**Path 1: Order more units**

| Units | FOB price | Landed | Works at $44? |
|-------|-----------|--------|---------------|
| 10 | $65-75 | $80+ | ❌ |
| 50 | $50-55 | $60-65 | ❌ |
| 100 | $45-50 | $52-58 | ❌ |
| 200 | $38-42 | $46-50 | Almost |
| 300+ | $32-36 | $40-44 | ✅ |

**You need 300+ units to hit $44 landed.**

---

**Path 2: Raise launch price**

Keep your 50-100 unit first order, but price at $139-149 instead of $112.

At $149 retail, $55 landed:
- Fees: -$22
- FBA: -$6
- Product: -$55
- **Profit: $66/unit (44% margin)** ✅

Then drop price to $112 once you hit volume and costs go down.

---

**Path 3: Strip features for first batch**

Launch with dumb glasses first (no AI chip):
- Just camera + BT audio + tap controls
- FOB: $22-28
- Landed: $32-38 ✅

Prove demand. Fund the AI version with profits.

---

**Bottom line:**

- $44 landed at 10-50 units = impossible
- $44 landed at 300+ units = possible
- $44 landed at low volume = raise price or strip features

Which path fits your cash situation?

## USER

how to get it under 60 landed price

## ASSISTANT

 **Under $60 landed is doable at 50-100 units.**

Here's the breakdown:

---

**Target: $60 landed**

Work backwards:

| Cost | Amount |
|------|--------|
| FOB | $45-50 |
| Shipping (air, 50 units) | $6-8/unit |
| Import/duties | $3-4 |
| **Landed** | $54-62 |

---

**How to hit $45-50 FOB at 50 units:**

**1. Don't say "AI glasses"**

Say: "Bluetooth camera glasses with voice control"

"AI" adds $10-20 to every quote instantly.

**2. Use their existing mold**

Custom mold = $3,000-8,000 tooling + $5-10/unit markup

Existing frame = $0 tooling

**3. Skip Wi-Fi**

Wi-Fi module + antenna + certification = +$5-8/unit

BT only = cheaper, simpler

**4. Firmware tweaks only**

New features = engineering hours = $$

"Just add wake word to your existing dashcam firmware" = minimal cost

**5. Get 3 quotes competing**

Send same spec to 3-4 suppliers. Tell each one you're comparing. Prices drop 10-20%.

---

**The message to send:**

> "Need 50 units, Bluetooth camera glasses. Your existing frame. 1080p, loop recording, tap to save clip, BT audio, offline wake word (existing SDK okay). Logo print. No Wi-Fi. What's FOB?"

Short. No AI hype. No custom requests.

---

**At $112 retail, $58 landed:**

- Amazon fees: -$16.80
- FBA: -$5.50
- Product: -$58
- **Profit: $31.70 (28% margin)**

Tight but survivable for launch. Margin improves at scale.

Want the Chinese version for 1688?

## USER

fro my first 10

## ASSISTANT

 **Real talk: $60 landed at 10 units is a fight, but here's how to get close:**

---

**The problem:**

10 units = no leverage, sample pricing, per-unit shipping kills you

Normal quote for 10 "AI glasses": $75-90 landed

---

**How to push toward $60:**

**1. Don't buy "glasses" - buy the board**

Buy 10 bare AI camera modules (RV1106/Ingenic) from 1688: **$12-18 each**

Test that the chip actually works before you commit to glasses form factor.

**2. Buy existing product, not custom**

Find glasses already selling on 1688 for Chinese market: **$30-40 retail**

That means their FOB is $18-25. You're buying what they already make, no sample tax.

**3. Ship slow**

Air freight 10 units: $15-25/unit
Sea freight (with other goods or consolidator): $5-8/unit

Use a freight forwarder that does small batch sea consolidation.

**4. The "future volume" play**

> "10 samples now. 200 units in 60 days if testing passes. Price the 10 like a partner, not a stranger."

---

**Realistic best case at 10 units:**

| | Normal | Snipe price |
|--|--------|-------------|
| FOB | $55-65 | $40-48 |
| Shipping | $15-20 | $8-12 (sea/consolidator) |
| **Landed** | $70-85 | $50-60 |

---

**The $60 landed 10-unit play:**

1. Find existing product on 1688 (not "custom AI glasses")
2. Use volume commitment language
3. Ship sea consolidation not air
4. Skip any customization on first 10 - just logo sticker if anything

Want me to find actual 1688 listings that fit this?

## USER

giive me 15 angles ot inntergaet the idea i have rightnow wit  under 6o landed cost . think factor that i need them in the fram i found on alibaba but i havnt search 1688 to see their product of if  they ahve the frame

## ASSISTANT

 **15 angles to hit under $60 landed with your Alibaba frame:**

---

**SOURCING ANGLES**

**1. Same factory, different platform**
Take your Alibaba supplier's company name → search 1688 → same product, 20-30% cheaper (Alibaba is export markup)

**2. Frame from Alibaba, board from 1688**
Buy the glasses frame shell only from your Alibaba guy ($15-20)
Buy RV1106 AI board separately from 1688 ($12-15)
Find local assembler or do it yourself for first 10

**3. Reverse image search**
Screenshot your Alibaba frame → drop in 1688 image search → find the actual factory or cheaper reseller

**4. Ask Alibaba supplier for 1688 link**
Literally ask: "Do you have 1688 store? I want to order domestic price for samples"
Some will give it, some won't

**5. Buy their existing SKU, not custom**
Ask: "What's your cheapest in-stock model with BT audio + camera? I'll take that, just add logo sticker"
No firmware changes, no customization = cheapest price

---

**NEGOTIATION ANGLES**

**6. Deposit on future order**
"I'll pay 20% deposit now on 200 units, ship 10 samples at production pricing"
They're locked in, you get cheap samples

**7. Multi-supplier bid**
Get 3-4 quotes, screenshot lowest price, send to others: "Can you match?"

**8. Pay faster**
"I'll pay 100% upfront today if you can do $45 FOB"
Cash now beats payment terms for small factories

**9. Accept B-stock/refurb**
"Do you have returns, cosmetic defects, or overstock? I'll take 10 at discount"
Test the tech, who cares about scratches

**10. Bundle with another buyer**
Find someone else ordering from same factory, combine shipment, split costs

---

**SHIPPING ANGLES**

**11. Sea freight consolidator**
Use Superbuy, Sugargoo, or freight forwarder that batches small orders
$5-8/unit vs $15-25 air

**12. Ship to agent first**
Send to Chinese agent/warehouse, they combine with other shipments monthly

**13. Slow boat + wait**
Sea freight takes 30-45 days but saves $10-15/unit on 10 pieces

---

**PRODUCT ANGLES**

**14. Strip AI from first 10**
Order base glasses (camera + BT audio only) at $25-30 FOB
Test fit, feel, quality, recording
Add AI board yourself or in v2

**15. Buy the dashcam, harvest the board**
RV1106 AI dashcams sell for $30-40 on 1688
Buy 10, rip the boards, test the silicon works
Then commission glasses frame with same board

---

**Your move:**

1. Drop your Alibaba supplier name/link
2. I'll search 1688 for same factory or same frame
3. We find the gap and close it

What's the supplier?

## USER

if the boards work i win>?

## ASSISTANT

 **Yeah, if the boards work you basically win.**

Here's why:

---

**The board is the whole product.**

Everything else is commodity:

| Part | Hard to source? |
|------|-----------------|
| AI board (RV1106/Ingenic) | ✅ This is the brain |
| Plastic frame | ❌ Thousands of molds exist |
| BT speakers | ❌ $2-3, everywhere |
| Mic | ❌ $0.50, everywhere |
| Battery | ❌ $2-3, everywhere |
| USB-C port | ❌ Pennies |

If the board runs:
- Wake word ✅
- Basic vision tagging ✅
- Clip save on command ✅

Then you just need someone to **house it in glasses** - that's assembly, not engineering.

---

**The sequence:**

1. **Buy 2-3 dashcam boards from 1688** ($25-40 each)
2. **Test:** wake word triggers? saves clips? BT audio routes?
3. **If yes →** take board to glasses frame factory
4. **Say:** "Put this inside your frame, add speakers/mic/battery"
5. **That's a $5-10 assembly job**, not a $30 custom dev job

---

**Why this is the snipe:**

You're not asking anyone to:
- Develop AI firmware ❌
- Source chips ❌
- Figure out wake word ❌
- Build something new ❌

You're handing them a working brain and saying "put clothes on it."

---

**Risk check:**

| If boards work | You win |
|----------------|---------|
| If boards trash | You're out $80-120 on test units |

That's a cheap bet to validate the whole product.

---

**Next step:**

Find 2-3 RV1106 or Ingenic AI dashcam listings on 1688, order them, test the silicon.

Want me to hunt those listings?

## USER

now facotr in thee size and how to conceptilize its fittingand effect on lenses

## ASSISTANT

 Good point - let me visualize how these chips actually fit in glasses frames and affect lens space:

**[View Chip Sizing & Frame Fit Guide](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/SCION_CHIP_SIZING_FRAME_FIT.md)**

---

## THE QUICK ANSWER:

### Your JL AC7016F frame temple is probably ~6-7mm internal width

**FITS WITHOUT TOUCHING ANYTHING:**
| Chip | Size | vs Temple | Lens Impact |
|------|------|-----------|-------------|
| RV1103B | 5x5mm | 2mm clearance | NONE |
| T23L | 6x6mm | 1mm clearance | NONE |
| RV1103 | 6x6mm | 1mm clearance | NONE |
| T31ZL | 8x8mm | Snug fit | NONE |
| K210 | 8x8mm | Snug fit | NONE |

**WON'T FIT:**
| Chip | Size | Problem |
|------|------|---------|
| RV1106 | 10x10mm | 3mm too wide |
| T32 | 11x11mm | Need new frame |
| RV1109 | 12x12mm | Sports glasses only |

---

## KEY INSIGHT:

**Temple-mounted chips = ZERO lens impact**

Your prescription lenses, lens coatings, photochromic, blue light filter - all completely unaffected. The chip sits in the arm, heat goes outward away from face, lens stays cool.

**Best fit for your frame:** T31ZL (8x8mm) or RV1103 (6x6mm)

## ASSISTANT

 Now I can see your actual frame. This is helpful - let me analyze it:

---

## YOUR FRAME ANALYSIS

**What I see:**
- **Total width:** 155mm (standard adult size)
- **Temple arms:** Thick, chunky design - looks like **8-10mm wide**
- **Style:** Half-rim/clubmaster style with thick top bar
- **Camera:** Left temple, front-facing
- **Temple length:** 155mm (long, lots of room)
- **Frame:** Thick acetate/plastic - **MORE room than I estimated**

---

## REVISED FIT ASSESSMENT

Your temples are **chunkier than standard Ray-Ban Stories** - this is GOOD news:

| Chip | Size | Fit in YOUR Frame | Notes |
|------|------|-------------------|-------|
| RV1103B | 5x5mm | ✅ Easy | Tons of room |
| T23L | 6x6mm | ✅ Easy | Tons of room |
| RV1103 | 6x6mm | ✅ Easy | Tons of room |
| T31ZL | 8x8mm | ✅ Easy | Comfortable fit |
| K210 | 8x8mm | ✅ Easy | Comfortable fit |
| T31L | 9x9mm | ✅ Works | Good fit |
| SSC335 | 9x9mm | ✅ Works | Good fit |
| **RV1106** | 10x10mm | ✅ **NOW FITS** | Your thick temples handle it |
| T32 | 11x11mm | ⚠️ Tight | Might work |
| RV1109 | 12x12mm | ⚠️ Maybe | Push the limit |

---

## KEY OBSERVATION

That thick temple design means you can fit **bigger chips than I originally said**. The 155mm temple length also gives you room to spread components:

```

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
     155mm total temple length
```

---

## UPDATED RECOMMENDATION

**With your thick temples, go for RV1106 (10x10mm):**

| Spec | RV1106G2 |
|------|----------|
| Size | 10x10mm - **FITS YOUR FRAME** |
| NPU | 0.5 TOPS |
| Price | $5-8 chip |
| AI Runtime | 22min on 270mAh |
| Heat | +10°C |

You don't need to compromise on the smaller T31ZL - your frame can handle the better chip.

**Lens impact: Still ZERO** - chip is in temple, far from lens area.
