## ASSISTANT

 You're asking about the biology of what's happening when someone takes Plan B (emergency contraception) and then misses their period.

**Here's what's actually going on:**

Plan B (levonorgestrel) works primarily by **delaying or preventing ovulation** — meaning it stops the egg from being released in the first place. If there's no egg, there's no fertilization, so conception never occurs.

**If conception already happened before taking Plan B:**

This is where it gets important — Plan B is **not effective after fertilization has occurred**. It doesn't prevent a fertilized egg from implanting, and it won't terminate an existing pregnancy. Studies have confirmed this.

**So about the missed period:**

The absence of a period after Plan B is usually caused by the **hormonal disruption** from the high dose of synthetic progesterone, not by conception. Plan B essentially throws off the normal cycle timing. Periods can come early, late, or be heavier/lighter than usual.

**To directly answer your question:**

No, a missed period after Plan B doesn't mean conception already occurred. It's far more likely the hormones just disrupted her cycle. However, if a period is more than a week late, taking a pregnancy test is the only way to know for certain — because if ovulation had *already* happened before she took Plan B, there's a window where it wouldn't have been effective.
