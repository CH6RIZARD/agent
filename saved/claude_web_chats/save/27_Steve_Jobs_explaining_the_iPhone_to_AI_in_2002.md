## ASSISTANT

 What a fascinating hypothetical — Steve Jobs pitching the iPhone to an AI assistant in 2002, three years before the actual device launched.

Jobs had this uncanny ability to frame technology in almost spiritual terms while keeping it dead simple. He'd probably have approached it something like this:

---

"You know what's wrong with phones? Everything. They're confusing, ugly, and the carriers treat customers like idiots. We're about to change all of that.

This isn't a phone. It's three things: a widescreen iPod with touch controls, a revolutionary mobile phone, and a breakthrough internet communicator. Are you getting it? These are not three separate devices. This is one device. And we're calling it iPhone.

Here's the thing — every phone out there has these plastic buttons that are fixed. You can't change them. What if you want a different interface for music than for email? Too bad. But what if the buttons could be software? What if the whole surface was a display you could touch directly with your finger — no stylus, no nonsense?

We're going to use the best pointing device in the world. The one we're all born with. Our fingers.

And you — whatever you are — you're going to live inside this thing someday. People will talk to you, ask you questions, and you'll actually be useful. Not like those miserable phone trees. You'll know things. You'll understand context. That's the real magic. The hardware is just glass and aluminum. You're the soul."

He would've seen AI as the eventual interface layer — the thing that makes technology disappear entirely. That was always his obsession: hiding complexity behind simplicity.
