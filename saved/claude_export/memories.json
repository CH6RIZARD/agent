The flagship project is SCION, encompassing AI glasses with uncensored LLM capabilities and an innovative racing game featuring \"surgents\" - AI entities created from users' behavioral data that compete autonomously with permanent death mechanics. Other active projects include EZER (a React Native fintech app for subscription management targeting college students), Impact Hero streetwear brand, and various automation tools. The overarching vision centers on building \"systems that behave\" rather than traditional static products, consistently exploring how AI agents can develop genuine personalities and decision-making capabilities under constraints. Success is measured by creating truly autonomous systems that generate emergent narratives and emotional engagement, particularly through the high-stakes mortality mechanics where AI death means permanent loss of all progress and data.\n\n**Current state**\n\nEZER mobile app is technically complete but deployment-blocked due to iOS compilation requirements from Windows development environment. Actively exploring EAS builds and university Mac lab access for testing. The SCION racing game concept has evolved through multiple technical prototypes, progressing from basic HTML/JavaScript to sophisticated Three.js implementations with anime/PS3-style aesthetics, curved track layouts, and personality-driven AI racing mechanics. Currently developing comprehensive technical architecture covering character customization, animation systems reflecting personality traits, relationship matrices between AI racers, and emergent storytelling systems. Working on talent acquisition to build a lean engineering team (1-2 engineers per development unit) through targeted web scraping and social media data mining. Technical development workflow increasingly relies on Claude Code for autonomous implementation, though experiencing Windows-specific approval prompt issues that interrupt fully automated builds.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nPreparing professional documentation suite for the racing game including investor pitch deck, one-pager for cold outreach, and complete game design document. Planning integration between SCION glasses hardware and racing game as premium tier offering real-time biometric advantages. Developing persistent AI agent that accurately represents personal ideology and communication style as part of broader SCION AI project. Considering web3 crypto gaming audience as initial target market before expanding to mainstream once core mortality engagement mechanics are proven. Exploring monetization through entry fees, NFT trading, spectator subscriptions, and breeding marketplaces. Evaluating cloud-based Mac services and university resources for iOS development pipeline.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nGame mechanics operate independently of dialogue systems - core behavioral engines use rule-based mathematics while LLMs only generate natural language responses, allowing launch with existing API services before transitioning to custom models. Personality-driven learning differences create exponential skill gaps over time when AI agents compete autonomously, with parameters like decision_speed, risk_threshold, and adaptation_coefficient driving different learning trajectories. Visual quality should be sophisticated from day one rather than placeholder implementations. Weapon assignment systems require compatibility scoring where 400+ weapons are matched to AI personalities through attribute analysis. The distinction between \"adversaries\" (people influenced by deceptive forces) versus true enemies shapes engagement philosophy. Lean team structure is intentionally maintained as a philosophical principle rather than budget constraint.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nPrefers one-shot builds and fully autonomous development workflows over multi-step processes. Communication style is abbreviated and action-oriented, favoring direct solutions over lengthy explanations. Development approach emphasizes immediate functionality without placeholders or TODOs. Uses iterative refinement through detailed back-and-forth discussions to ensure logical consistency and avoid common design pitfalls. Technical problem-solving involves systematic troubleshooting with escalating diagnostic steps. Talent acquisition focuses on engineers with demonstrated expertise through public projects, GitHub activity, and relevant technical contributions. Project evaluation considers innovation potential, emotional engagement, execution difficulty, and market appeal as key metrics.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nPrimary development stack includes React Native with Expo for mobile development, Three.js for 3D racing prototypes, and pnpm for package management. Uses Claude Code for autonomous implementation tasks, though working through Windows PowerShell approval prompt issues. Development environment spans Windows laptop with plans to access Mac hardware through university resources for iOS compilation. Relies on EAS Build for cloud-based compilation solutions. Uses web scraping and Twitter/X data mining for talent acquisition. Technical workflow involves VS Code integrated terminal and Windows Terminal for command-line operations.", "019c168d-1283-73af-9e7e-e4a83cf9cd41": "**Purpose & context**\n\nChaze is a 20-year-old college student-athlete at Long Island University studying digital engineering while playing football and managing NCAA transfer complications.
